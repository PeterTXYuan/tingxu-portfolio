# GAN Research (PPRAI)
**Jun 2022 â€“ Aug 2022**

**Problem.** Lacked sufficient labeled images for training robust models.  
**Approach.** Trained GANs to synthesize realistic samples for dataset augmentation under MIT mentorship.  
**Impact.** Improved downstream model generalization in small-data settings; co-authored a published paper.  
**Tech.** Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib.
